Software-defined networking (SDN) is a relatively new paradigm for network management that allows a software-based controller to communicate with the individual network components to create optimal end-to-end routing policies. Following his recent development of the new NetKAT network language, [Professor Nate Foster](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) of computer science at Cornell University supervised my independent study project to learn about this emerging new research field. This independent study concluded in the development of *Gates App*, an SDN controller for the 28-switch network of Gates Hall, home of Cornell’s computer science department. *Gates App* employs the [Frenetic Project](http://www.frenetic-lang.org/) libraries to perform Ethernet routing and host discovery for a dynamically changing network.
