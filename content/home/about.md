# Biography

I'm an MSc student at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa) in Saudi Arabia, currently focused on the development of novel computer vision techniques for video understanding. I'm part of the multicultural and diverse [Image and Video Understanding Lab (IVUL)](https://ivul.kaust.edu.sa/) advised by [Bernard Ghanem](http://www.bernardghanem.com). I received my undergraduate degree in both Computer Science and Mathematics from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu) in 2016. My main research interests are in video understanding and human activity detection. In general, I'm interested in computer vision and machine learning.
